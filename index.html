            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I am a junior at Texas Christian University pursuing a degree in Business Information 
Systems with a minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics. My academic path reflects a 
passion for understanding how technology and data can transform organizations, 
streamline processes, and drive better decision-making.</p>

            <p>Outside of the classroom, I am an active member of the Neeley Leadership Program, where 
I focus on developing self-awareness, communication, and leadership skills. I also serve as 
the New Member Experience Director for my sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, where I 
oversee events, budgeting, and member development programming. Both of these 
experiences have strengthened my organizational and leadership abilities.
</p>

<p>My goals include pursuing internships in consulting or technology-focused roles, with the 
long-term aim of building a career that bridges business strategy and digital innovation. I 
value faith, health, relationships, and growth, and I bring that mindset into both my 
professional and personal pursuits.</p>
