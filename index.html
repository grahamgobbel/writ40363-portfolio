        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Graham Gobbel, a student at Texas Christian University majoring in Business Information Systems with a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. 
            I enjoy exploring how technology, business strategy, and people intersect, and I’ve had experiences ranging from interning with a bank’s
            data and AI teams to serving as New Member Experience Director in my sorority.

        <h3>Education & Interests</h3>

        <p>I am originally from <em>Columbus, GA</em> and just started my junior year.
             At TCU, I’m part of the Neeley Leadership Program, where I’m developing skills in self-awareness, 
             communication, and teamwork. Outside of school I love to go on runs and walks, do hot yoga, and hang out with my friends.</p>

        <h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>

        <p>After getting somewhat familiar with HTML my senior year of highschool, I hope to refresh my skills and improve upon them! 
            In this coding class, my main goal is to build confidence in my programming abilities and strengthen my problem-solving mindset. 
            I want to push myself to not only understand how the code works but also to see its broader applications in business and analytics.</p>
