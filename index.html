      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a junior at Texas Christian University pursuing a degree in Business Information
        Systems with a minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics. My academic path reflects a
        passion for understanding how technology and data can transform organizations,
        streamline processes, and drive better decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of the classroom, I am an active member of the Neeley Leadership Program, where
        I focus on developing self-awareness, communication, and leadership skills. I also serve as
        the New Member Experience Director for my sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, where I
        oversee events, budgeting, and member development programming. Both of these
        experiences have strengthened my organizational and leadership abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goals include pursuing internships in consulting or technology-focused roles, with the
        long-term aim of building a career that bridges business strategy and digital innovation. I
        value faith, health, relationships, and growth, and I bring that mindset into both my
        professional and personal pursuits.
