Project 3 Reflection:

Project 3 ended up being the first time I felt like I was building something that actually reflected my personality instead of just checking boxes on a rubric. The personal dashboard let me mix all the new technical things we learned with details that made it feel like my dashboard, not just an assignment. It also pushed me into understanding things like fetch(), JSON, asynchronous JavaScript, and theme systems in a way that actually clicked.

The biggest moment of understanding for me was learning how fetch() and asynchronous JavaScript work. I had seen .then() before, but I honestly never understood why it was necessary until this project. I kept getting undefined values in my weather widget, which annoyed me enough that I finally dug into why JavaScript does not wait for data to load. Once I realized that fetch() does not return data right away and the whole point of .then() is to run code only after the data arrives, it made so much more sense. It also helped me understand why real websites use loading states, error messages, and fallbacks. I definitely learned how to debug asynchronous code from experience, but I am glad I did because it finally made sense.

Another big takeaway was understanding the difference between data stored with localStorage and data pulled in with fetch(). I liked how the tasks widget still used localStorage like in Project 2 because it showed me how user-created data should stay available across sessions. But the weather and quotes being loaded through JSON files made the dashboard feel more like an actual app. Seeing the two work together in one project made me feel like I now understand what dashboards and interfaces are doing behind the scenes.

What made this project more fun was adding personal touches. I added more than fifty quotes to my quotes.json file because I wanted the dashboard to feel inspiring and personal. I changed the font to Georgia, which was a small hint toward my hometown that probably only I would notice, but I liked that. I also added a welcome message at the top so the dashboard felt more like something made for a real user. These little details made the whole project feel more like something I would actually use.
I also extended the weather section beyond the one-day forecast. I added four extra days to make it feel like a real five day forecast. Doing that required me to understand how arrays of objects work in JSON and how to access them correctly. Expanding the weather file forced me to debug my JavaScript again because I broke the structure at first. After correcting the property names and making sure my fetch code matched the JSON structure, it finally worked. Seeing the extended forecast show up on my page felt like a real accomplishment.

Theme switching was another part I enjoyed. Before this project, I thought light mode and dark mode were a lot more complicated than they actually are. Once I understood that it can all be done by switching CSS custom properties, it felt very manageable. It showed me why developers use variables in CSS and how much easier it becomes to maintain consistent styles.

Looking back at Projects 1 through 3, I can clearly see how much my skills have grown. In the first project, I was mainly focused on layout. In Project 2, I learned how to use JavaScript and localStorage. But Project 3 combined everything and pushed me to think like a developer. I had to debug real issues, work with multiple data sources, and design a dashboard that felt intentional. Even though there were moments of frustration, especially with JSON errors, I came out of it feeling more confident.

Overall, this project was the right mix of challenge and creativity. I learned how to work with asynchronous data, how to organize separate JSON files, how to use CSS variables for theming, and how to design a clean and functional interface. The project helped me clearly see my progress from the beginning of the semester to now, and I am proud of the final result.
