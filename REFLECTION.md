#My HW3 Reflection

1. Confidence Check: I feel good so far! This honestly feels a bit easier for me to pick up than python, and I enjoy how structured everything is. Since we haven't done that much so far, I'm not exavtly sure if I can pinpoint specific skills that feel solid or challenging, but nothing has been too difficult so far.

2. Learning Curve: Learning Git and GitHub has been good so far, although I feel like I haven't explored it enough. My only challenge was initally linking the wrong folder and not understanding why I didn't have any changes to push through, but that was an easy fix.

3. Problem-Solving Growth: When I encountered problems I either asked Professor Rode or a classmate. This hasn't changed much since last week, but I definitely see improvement in asking questions compared to last year in the Python class.

4. Professional Mindset: To be honest, I have not noticed a huge difference so far, but I'm excited to keep learning how to go past the surface level.

5. Week 2 Reflection: Although it might be silly, my biggest aha moments were coding things like italics or bold because I could quickly see them show up on the preview, rather than just coding something like a paragraph text.

6. Looking Forward: I'm excited to get more in-depth and learn how to do things like implement buttons, surveys, etc. For someone without a huge coding background, it's super cool even to learn how  to do smaller things like those.

7. Support and Resources: I definitely think that walking through things together as a class has been the most helpful. Usually when we run into problems, other people have them too, and they can easily be fixed. I also enjoy collaborating with classmates because it allows us to be more open with each other and share ideas. Moving forward, if more of our work comes outside of the classroom, I might need more detailed instructions, however that has not been a problem so far.
